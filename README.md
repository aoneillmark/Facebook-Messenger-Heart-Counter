This is a repository for counting the number of hearts per user in a Facebook Messenger groupchat (and also average hearts per message per user; e.g Mark gets 0.48 hearts per message)
Also plots bar charts for added convenience if you hate reading numbers.
Just a silly little project to rank my friends in our groupchat.

Example of results:

^ I quite like this one because I've shown that all of us in the groupchat receive "heart" reactions roughly the same (with some non-linearity for the less active members), some of us just talk more and hence get more hearts!
